                💻 I'm a <strong>passionate software developer</strong> with close to <strong>6 years of experience</strong> in building innovative digital solutions. 
                Currently seeking <strong>full-time opportunities</strong> where I can leverage my expertise in <strong>backend technologies</strong> and contribute to cutting-edge projects.
              </p>
              <p class="apple-text-body">
                🚀 My technical passion lies in <strong>backend development</strong> and <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong>. I love diving deep into complex systems, 
                optimizing performance, and creating scalable architectures that can handle real-world challenges.
              </p>
              <p class="apple-text-body">
                🌍 Beyond coding, I'm an <strong>avid traveler and adventure seeker</strong> who thrives on challenges. I've completed <strong>solo trips across 7 countries</strong>, 
                embracing new cultures and pushing my boundaries. This same spirit of exploration and resilience translates into my work - 
                I approach every technical challenge with curiosity, determination, and a drive to find elegant solutions.
              </p>
              <p class="apple-text-body">
                📈 I believe in <strong>continuous learning and growth</strong>, both professionally and personally. Every day is an opportunity to become a better developer, 
                problem solver, and human being. My goal is to create applications that not only solve problems but also make a <strong>meaningful impact</strong> on people's lives.
